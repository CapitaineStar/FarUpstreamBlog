I'm making a game!

Estimated current progress = **1%**

I kinda know what I want to make but have no idea what it will become. The current goal is to have a functionnal prototype as quickly as possible. I intend on being pretty open about the developement of this game. There will be good fortunes and mishaps along the way and provided they are not too embarassing, I will share it here.

Oh! also, there is no official title for now (**TO DO**) but here's what it's all about:

### The elevator pitch

The game is a strategic-shooter about tracking down an adversary across the multiverse. The player has to find and choose the right gear to complete his task. The world is lifeless, hostile and full of surprises. Viewed from a third-person perspective and with a 3D environment created with procedural art on acid.

I will not get into the details right now 

Short experience

As for the game "soul", I'm still trying to put words on  so I will leave you with a quote for 

But even if the universe were to crush him, man would still be nobler than his slayer, because he knows that he is dying and the advantage the universe has over him, the universe knows none of this. - *Blaise Pascal*

### Toolbox

Unreal Engine: It's amazing what this tool has become. Open-source, regular updates and some fantastic workflow tools make this choice pretty easy.

Houdini: My new found love. I don't know how I've been able to live before learning it. 

### About the Dev Blog

Hopefully, I will update this blog at a regular interval. There will be work-in-progress screenshots, update on current status and probably a couple of stories about how I fucked up something. Also, I have the intention of creating some short tutorials to, you know, give back. The majority of the knowledge I currently have or will eventually learn comes from online sources so it's about damn time I contribute a little!

Feel free to share some of my posts if you think it's worth it.

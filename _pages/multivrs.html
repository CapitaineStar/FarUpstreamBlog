        <p class="post-title">Summary</p>
        <p> <i><b>Multivrs</b></i> was the name for a video game project that was in development for a year. I worked on it alone and created all the assets, code and design. It was made in Unreal Engine and mostly all 3D models were done in Houdini. The game had strategic and shooter gameplay elements and was about tracking down an adversary across the multiverse. There was item and gear to pick up in a lifeless and hostile world. The environment was using 3D procedural art, ensuring each game session to be unique.</p>

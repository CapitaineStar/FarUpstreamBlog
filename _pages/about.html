        I am J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Viens Brie (AKA Capitaine Star) and I've been making games for almost 6 years now. Most of my time as been spent on AAA titles at Ubisoft Quebec (<a href="http://jeromebrie.com" target="_blank">check out the stuff I worked on!</a>). My last official job title has been "Assistant" Technical Art Director, which basically means that I make sure the game works fine by constantly nagging the programmers and preventing artists to do too much damage. I have an academic background in computer science AND Arts so that makes me some kind of jake-of-all-trades. With all those skills and experience, I'm sure <a href="https://goo.gl/YcPrAh" target="_blank">everything will be juuust fine</a>.
